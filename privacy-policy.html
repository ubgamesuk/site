        <h4 class="footnote">Last updated - 10th April 2025</h4>
        <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">At ubgames, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you visit or interact with this site. By accessing or using ubgames.uk, ubmini.com or any of our externally provided links, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">1. Information we collect</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">We use Google Analytics to track user-specific data (shared anonymously), such as your general location, the pages you visit and the amount of time you spend on each page. You have the option to change these settings at any time by clicking on the grey shield icon in the bottom-right corner of every page. As stated in our Data Preferences control popup, your browser stores data for personalised advertising and content measurement, audience research and site data to improve your experience when using the site.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Cookies. We use cookies to improve your experience while using the site. Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us to store/save your preferences and understand how you interact with ubgames. Game data is stored in your device's RAM (Random Access Memory) - meaning devices with lower RAM capacity will have less space to store game data, which may also reduce your device's performance.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">2. How we use your information</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">We use your information to improve the services on our site and gain insights on the usage of our site, for example to view how many users are using the site at a given time and which games they are playing. We also use your information to show personalised ads that are relevant to you. You can change these settings at any time (as mentioned in section 1).</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">3. Advertising and Third Party Services</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">Our main source of revenue comes from advertisements placed in strategic locations across our site.. These are shown in a small box to the right of every game and in horizontal banner form on other pages. We use data collected by Google to show ads that are right for you - which is collected from other sites you have visited, Google search queries and your browser history. You can opt out of this at any time by using the Data Preferences feature within our website or by removing specific permissions in your web browser settings. We can't see any of the data that is processed through this service as it is fully encrypted. All Google Analytics data (GA4) is also fully encrypted so it is kept private.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">4. Shared Information</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">We do not sell any of our user data to third parties, nor do we make any profit from your data. Your usage data is stored solely for analytical processing so it is also kept confidential. In rare cases, we may disclose your information if required by law or in response to a valid request by a public authority.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">5. Data Preferences</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">It is easy to update your preferences for how we use your data. Click the shield icon in the bottom-right corner of every page to reveal the Google data popup (available on ubgames.uk and ubmini.com). You can easily change permissions for individual vendors/services, and disable cookie usage.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">6. Privacy of Children</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">We are designed to be a website for all ages, so we have clearly stated the recommended age rating of every game on their individual game tile on the 'Games A-Z' page and on the right-hand side of every game page. Though our site is typically aimed at people over the age of 4, it is recommended that children aged 4 to 9 should play with adult supervision to ensure maximum safety. It is important to read the game description before playing the game so you know what to expect from the game.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Safety is our top priority - if you are a parent who is concerned about any of the content available on this site, feel free to contact us via email at contact@ubgames.uk. We read all emails and typically tend to reply within two working days. If you see an advertisement on our site that you deem inappropriate, you can report it to Google by clicking 'AdChoices' in the corner of a specific ad. Google will review your report and remove the ad as soon as possible.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">7. Contact us</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">If you have any concerns about our privacy policy, feel free to contact us at contact@ubgames.uk - we would love to hear from you as it helps to improve this service for other users.</p>
